citation: "<b>Conference proceedings</b>: As ecological psychology has grown,
it has naturally shifted to examine more interpersonal and social phenomena,
embracing Gibson's early intuitions that the environment is not simply objects
and surfaces but also other organisms. We argue that ecological psychology must
grow to consider how intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1991) impacts social
effectivities and social affordances. (Paxton, Blau, & Weston, forthcoming,
<i>Studies in Perception and Action XV: Proceedings from the Twentieth
International Conference on Perception and Action</i>). Read our preprint!"
