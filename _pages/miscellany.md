* **[Spoonflower](https://blog.spoonflower.com/2018/06/how-to-design-a-fabric-research-poster-with-canva/)**:
  If you've been curious about cloth posters but haven't been interested in
  dropping 100 USD or more for one, try out Spoonflower. They're a fabric-printing
  service that easily accommodates research poster needs. Posters tend to run
  about 20 USD---and with rush shipping for 25 USD, it's still cheaper than most
  paper poster-printing services.
