Welcome to my website! I am a PhD researcher at the Reignite Multilateralism via Technology ([REMIT](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101094228)) project coodinated by [University College Maastricht](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/university-college-maastricht), Faculty of Science and Engineering, [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/nl) in Netherlands. I am also the Co-Founder of Saint Pierre Center for International Security ([SPCIS](http://www.spcis.org/)) where I lead the Critical Security Lab. My research interests include China's grand strategy & tech policy, computational social sciences, and critical security studies. I am particularly interested in questions related to (1) the role of high-tech in China's global rise process; (2) China's ontological insecurity and rising anxiety; (3) the patterns of China's foreign bahaviours. I received my Research Master in International Studies from [Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals](https://www.ibei.org/en) in June 2023.

My (co-)work has been published in several academic journals and medias, including *Latin American Research Review*, *The Diplomat*, *Panoramas*, and *Opinion China*. Before co-founding SPCIS, my previous working experiences cross academic institutions and think tanks, including [Harvard University](https://economics.harvard.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/ips/), [Intellisia Institute](https://www.intellisia.org/#/index), [Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies](http://rdcy.ruc.edu.cn/yw/HOME/index.htm), and [Inter-American Dialogue](https://www.thedialogue.org/programs/programs/china/). I also participated in the National-Building Dataset at [ETHNICGOODS](https://ethnicgoods.org/), an ERC-funded research project focusing on relationship between ethnic diversity and public goods provision.

Besides academic work, I enjoy playing badminton, sparing time with cats, and reading Wuxia. Please feel free to reach me at [hengyiyang@spcis.org](hengyiyang@spcis.org) for academic discussion or business development.
