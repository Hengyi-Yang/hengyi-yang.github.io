When we interact, we influence one another in subtle ways. Our individual behavioral signatures — the way we move, speak, and feel — start to become interconnected. We even recognize this colloquially:  People talk about how infectious smiles can be or how a yawn can spread through a room.

We most often notice this interconnectedness when we’re engaged in friendly conversation, but how does changing that conversational context affect interaction dynamics? How does conflict, especially, restructure our interaction patterns, and how can we better capture and model these dynamics?  As a cognitive scientist, I explore these and similar questions from a computational social science perspective.

My primary research interests lie in exploring the ways in which the structure of interpersonal interaction is affected by changing communicative contexts.  One of the lenses through which I often ask these questions is interpersonal coordination, or the ways in which interacting individuals grow to have similar behavior, cognition, and emotion over time.  I am specifically interested in exploring how communication patterns are shaped by asymmetric interaction contexts like argument.

As a computational social scientist, I pursue methods of quantifying interaction from a data-intensive perspective, like the frame-differencing method for analyzing body movement, B(eo)W(u)LF text analysis tool (both supported by the National Science Foundation under grants BCS-0826825 and BCS-0926670), and PsyGlass for Google Glass. In doing so, I hope to facilitate the kinds of data-rich research that underlies my own work.

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar working with Tom Griffiths at the Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. Together with Alison Gopnik and Dacher Keltner, we’re starting the Center for Data on the Mind, a new initiative to help cognitive scientists tap into the power of big data to explore questions about cognition and behavior. I am also a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, where I facilitate data-rich perspectives in cognitive science.

I earned my Ph.D. in Cognitive and Information Sciences in 2015 from the University of California, Merced (shown in a random photo above) with Rick Dale and his Cognaction Lab.
