Welcome to my website! I am a PhD researcher at the _Reignite Multilateralism via Technology_ ([REMIT](https://www.remit-research.eu)) project coordinated by [University College Maastricht](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/university-college-maastricht), Maastricht University in the Netherlands. I am also the Co-Founder of _Saint Pierre Center for International Security_ ([SPCIS](http://www.spcis.org/)) where I lead the Critical Security Lab. My research interests include China's grand strategy & tech policy, computational social sciences, and critical security studies. I am particularly interested in questions related to (1) China's foreign policy change and its ontological insecurity; (2) rising anxiety in international relations; (3) coalitions in China's tech policy and foreign policy. I am about to finish my Research Master in International Studies at [Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals](https://www.ibei.org/en) in June 2023.

My (co-)work has been published in several academic journals and medias, including *Latin American Research Review*, *The Diplomat*, *Panoramas*, and *Opinion China*. Before co-founding SPCIS, my previous working experiences cross academic institutions and think tanks, including Harvard University, Carnegie Mellon University, Intellisia Institute, Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, and Inter-American Dialogue. I also participated in the National-Building Dataset at [ETHNICGOODS](https://ethnicgoods.org/), an ERC-funded research project focusing on relationship between ethnic diversity and public goods provision.

Besides academic work, I enjoy playing badminton, sparing time with cats, and reading Wuxia. Please feel free to reach me at [hengyi.yang@maastrichtuniversity.nl](hengyi.yang@maastrichtuniversity.nl) for academic discussion or at [hengyiyang@spcis.org](hengyiyang@spcis.org) for business cooperation.
