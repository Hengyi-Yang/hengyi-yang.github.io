## Data-rich human communication

As a cognitive scientist and data scientist, I take a data-rich approach to
understanding how people work together, bond together, and fight together. To
do that, I combine a variety of data sources from the lab and the real world to
create a converging picture of the many ways in which our language, movement,
decisions, and emotions change during social contact. Understanding how context
---including conversational goals, social connections, and physical spaces---
shape our emerging behaviors is a primary goal of my research, embedded
within rich traditions of dynamical and ecological perspectives on human
behavior and cognition broadly.

I'm also interested in developing methods to quantify social interaction,
promoting open science research and education, and creating opportunities for
cognitive scientists and psychologists who are interested in big data and
data science.

## About me

I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar working with Tom Griffiths in the
Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences and a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow
in the Berkeley Institute for Data Science.

*In August 2018, I'll be joining the University of Connecticut’s Department of
Psychological Sciences as an Assistant Professor of Ecological Psychology
within the Perception, Action, Cognition division.*

<!-- When we interact, we influence one another in subtle ways. Our individual behavioral signatures — the way we move, speak, and feel — start to become interconnected. We even recognize this colloquially:  People talk about how infectious smiles can be or how a yawn can spread through a room. -->

<!-- We most often notice this interconnectedness when we’re engaged in friendly conversation, but how does changing that conversational context affect interaction dynamics? How does conflict, especially, restructure our interaction patterns, and how can we better capture and model these dynamics?  As a cognitive scientist, I explore these and similar questions from a computational social science perspective.

My primary research interests lie in exploring the ways in which the structure of interpersonal interaction is affected by changing communicative contexts.  One of the lenses through which I often ask these questions is interpersonal coordination, or the ways in which interacting individuals grow to have similar behavior, cognition, and emotion over time.  I am specifically interested in exploring how communication patterns are shaped by asymmetric interaction contexts like argument.

As a computational social scientist, I pursue methods of quantifying interaction from a data-intensive perspective, like the frame-differencing method for analyzing body movement, B(eo)W(u)LF text analysis tool (both supported by the National Science Foundation under grants BCS-0826825 and BCS-0926670), and PsyGlass for Google Glass. In doing so, I hope to facilitate the kinds of data-rich research that underlies my own work.

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar working with Tom Griffiths at the Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. Together with Alison Gopnik and Dacher Keltner, we’re starting the Data on the Mind, a new initiative to help cognitive scientists tap into the power of big data to explore questions about cognition and behavior. I am also a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, where I facilitate data-rich perspectives in cognitive science.

I earned my Ph.D. in Cognitive and Information Sciences in 2015 from the University of California, Merced with Rick Dale and his Cognaction Lab. -->
